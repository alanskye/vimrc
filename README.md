Make sure that you're using vim, not a vi editor.  
Download [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) as a vim package manager.  
Packages used in [.vimrc](https://github.com/alanskye/vimrc/blob/main/.vimrc):  
1. [Nerdtree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree): filesystem explorer in the Vim editor
2. [lightline](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim): status line plugin
3. [gruvbox](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/gruvbox): my favorite colorscheme
